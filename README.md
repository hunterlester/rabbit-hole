### Rabbit Hole

> So much to learn yet life is so short. Down the rabbit hole together


###### "What should I study?" "How should I use my time?"
These are questions I'm asking myself several times a day. I'm building this app for myself and people like me whom crave knowledge with a fire in their belly. I'm creating this app for people like me that worry about how little time on this Earth that we have to learn.

Rabbit Hole helps us organize the learning process and to get suggestions from other's on how better to focus our studies, based on what we want to learn.
