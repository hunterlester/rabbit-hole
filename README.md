### Rabbit Hole

> So much to learn yet life is so short. Down the rabbit hole together


###### "What should I study?, How should I use my time?"
These are questions I'm asking myself several times a day. I'm building this app for myself and people like myself whom crave knowledge with a fire in their belly. I'm creating this app for people like me that worry about how little time on this Earth that we have to learn.

Rabbit Hole helps us to organize the learning process and to get suggestions from others on how better to focus our studies, based on what we want to learn.

### Features:
- Identify desired subject of study
- Quickly save and organize links to resources
- Pose questions to the community
- Subject branches are open to helpful tips

Brainstorms:

Cohesion occurs in unexpected ways. Community members can suggest related learning resources that will help to learn particular concepts.

Sometimes you just have a quick and simple question that you want answered. Simple question that annoys StackOverflow.

Users identify what they're studying as well as their knowledge base which may be helpful to other users. Their feed will reflect those two factors.
